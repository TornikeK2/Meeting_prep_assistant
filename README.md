Automated Meeting Preparation Assistant (AMPA)


Project Purpose

Problem Statement
Professionals spend 15-30 minutes before each meeting manually searching for relevant documents and gathering context. With 8-12 meetings per week, this represents 2-4 hours of weekly preparation time. Information is scattered across Google Calendar and Drive, leading to inconsistent preparation quality.
Proposed Solution
An autonomous AI agent that monitors Google Calendar, searches Drive for relevant documents, and automatically generates meeting preparation summaries.
